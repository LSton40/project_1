# Project 1: NOWHERE SPECIAL 

# Creators - Craig Bailey, Logan Sutton, Mark Ustby

## Synopsis

You and your partner, friends, or family are sitting around and someone brings up going to get food but no one has any clue on what they want. 
You all sit around for the next 10-20 minutes debating your options and how much you're willing to spend. 
With ‘Nowhere Special’ the decision can be made in as little as 30 seconds. 
Just input how far you are willing to travel and your price point and ‘Nowhere Special’ will give you a random restaurant selection near you with all your specifications without any arguments or debates.
